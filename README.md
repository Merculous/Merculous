# About me

Just a Python script kiddie who like to mess around with compression and iOS.

# Programming language I know

Python, that's it :/

# Why aren't my projects any good?

I only make my projects to serve a purpose for what I was trying to accomplish
at that time. They're rarely updated and if they happen to be, it's probably
because I got back into what I was doing for the project, or I saw terrible code
and tried to make it better, probably both tbh.

# Nothing else to add here?

I don't know. Not enough people use my stuff and give feedback. Some people are
using my stuff but I have no idea why and what actual useful purpose my code serves
to others. Everything I've basically made was just to get rid of redundant labor.
Sometimes projects did have an actual useful purpose, but they haven't been worked
on, so they're just frameworks for people who needed something close to what I made
for their own research, idk.
